# Python Sudoku Solver

I created a class that represents a sudoku board as well as a GUI that
allows the user to play the game. The class contains four different
algorithms for solving the board, including depth first searching,
breadth first searching, and recursive backtracking. The class also
uses these algorithms in another method which creates randomly
generated sudoku puzzles that each have a unique solution. The GUI is
made using the Tkinter library, and it lets the user easily interact
with the game board. It shows the user if the number they selected for
a particular square is correct and gives them the option to solve the
puzzle using one of the four algorithms or generate a new board
entirely.
